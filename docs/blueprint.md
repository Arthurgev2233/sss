## Core Features:

- Payment Instructions Image: Display an image explaining how to pay with LivePix (image URL: https://link-da-imagem-explicativa.png).
- Payment Button: A button labelled 'CLIQUE AQUI PARA PAGAR AGORA' that opens https://livepix.gg/viihcaliman in a new tab.
- Payment Confirmation Note: A small text note at the end: 'Ap칩s o pagamento, o acesso ser치 enviado automaticamente.'
- Page Optimization: Ensure the new tab/page is simple, lightweight, and responsive, with no external scripts, pixels, or automatic redirects.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: White (#FFFFFF).
- Primary color: A vibrant, attention-grabbing shade suitable for call-to-action buttons, such as a vivid orange (#FF6B6B).
- Accent color: An analogous color to the primary, such as a warm red-orange (#FF8B6B), to provide contrast and highlight important elements.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clear and responsive readability.
- The footnote 'Ap칩s o pagamento, o acesso ser치 enviado automaticamente' should have a light gray color.
- Ensure the layout is simple, focusing on the image and the call-to-action button to streamline the payment process. Responsiveness for mobile users should be considered.
